"""Task hierarchy for data pipeline processing.

Three task types by scope, dispatched via ``isinstance``:

- :class:`SampleTask` — per-sample, stateless, parallelisable.
- :class:`DatasetTask` — fit on full dataset, then apply per-sample.
- :class:`BatchTask` — post-collate batch processing.

    sample dicts. Runs on the hot path of every training step — keep it
    fast.

    molix ships no built-in :class:`BatchTask` subclass. The base class
    exists so custom post-collate transforms can be plugged into
    :meth:`Pipeline.add` and routed through
    :attr:`~molix.data.pipeline.PipelineSpec.batch_tasks` to the
    :class:`~molix.data.datamodule._CollateFn`.

    Use this only when the transform **must** operate on the collated
    batch (e.g. batch-level augmentation that mixes atoms across graphs,
    dense-padding for ``torch.compile``). Transforms expressible per
    sample should subclass :class:`SampleTask` instead — they benefit
    from per-sample caching, which :class:`BatchTask` cannot (the input
    shape is not known until collate time).
