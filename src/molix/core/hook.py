"""Hook contract layer for the Molix Trainer.

This module is the *interface* tier of the hook system:

* :class:`Hook` — the lifecycle :class:`typing.Protocol` that
  :class:`molix.core.trainer.Trainer` calls.
* :class:`BaseHook` — a concrete no-op implementation of every
  callback; users subclass it and override only what they need.
* :class:`ScalarHook` — an extension of ``BaseHook`` that advertises
  which :class:`~molix.core.state.Path` keys it writes into
  ``state``. Container hooks (e.g. ``Log``) read this attribute to
  decide which columns to render.

Concrete hook implementations (CheckpointHook, JournalHook,
GradClipHook, ...) live in :mod:`molix.hooks` — never in this
module. The contract layer must remain free of dependencies on the
side-tiers (``molix.hooks``, ``molix.io``, ``molix.recorder``).

    """Protocol for training hooks.

    Hooks receive notifications at various points in the training lifecycle.
    All methods are optional - implement only the hooks you need.

    Hook execution order:
    - By default, hooks execute in registration order
    - Use (hook, priority) tuples to override execution order
    - Lower priority values execute earlier (default priority = 100)
    - Hooks with same priority execute in registration order
    - If a hook raises an exception, it is logged but training continues

        ```python
        class MyHook:
            def on_epoch_end(self, trainer, state):
