"""Concrete hook implementations driven by :class:`molix.core.trainer.Trainer`.

The contract layer (:class:`Hook` Protocol, :class:`BaseHook`,
:class:`ScalarHook`) lives in :mod:`molix.core.hook`; this package
holds every concrete implementation. Naming convention: every
concrete class carries the ``Hook`` suffix
(``CheckpointHook``, ``JournalHook``, ``GradClipHook``, …) so the
boundary against the contract layer (whose three classes are
suffix-free) stays visually unambiguous.

Dependency direction: ``hooks/ → io/ + core/`` — never the reverse.
