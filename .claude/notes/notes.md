## TensorDict — no subclass for batch data (2026-05-18)

**Context.** `AtomData / EdgeData / GraphData / GraphBatch` were four empty
`TensorDict` subclasses that added zero functionality (no new methods, no
overrides) — only docstring-schema and type tags. They blocked `torch.compile`,
increased coupling to unstable tensordict subclass APIs, and created confusion
for newcomers needing to understand four type names for what is really just a
nested dict of tensors.

**Decision.** Removed all four subclasses (spec `tensordict-cleanup`).
Post-collate batch is now a plain `tensordict.TensorDict` with three nested
namespaces (`atoms`, `edges`, `graphs`). Schema contracts (field names,
shapes, `batch_size`) are documented in CLAUDE.md, not enforced by Python types.
Encoders are encouraged to inherit `TensorDictModuleBase` for `in_keys/out_keys`
validation, but `nn.Module` with `forward(td: TensorDict) -> TensorDict` is
also valid.

**Status.** stable (promoted to CLAUDE.md).
